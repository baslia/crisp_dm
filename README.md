# CRISP-DM Methodology

The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a robust and well-established data mining process model that provides a structured approach to planning a data mining project.
Here is a brief overview of the CRISP-DM process:

## 1. Business Understanding

This initial phase focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, and then converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition.

## 2. Data Understanding

The data understanding phase starts with an initial data collection and proceeds with activities in order to get familiar with the data, to identify data quality problems, to discover first insights into the data, or to detect interesting subsets to form hypotheses for hidden information.

## 3. Data Preparation

The data preparation phase covers all activities to construct the final dataset from the initial raw data.

## 4. Modeling

In this phase, various modeling techniques are selected and applied, and their parameters are calibrated to optimal values.

## 5. Evaluation

At this stage in the project, you have built a model (or models) that appears to have high quality, from a data analysis perspective. Before proceeding to final deployment of the model, it is important to more thoroughly evaluate the model, and review the steps executed to construct the model, to be certain it properly achieves the business objectives.

## 6. Deployment

Creation of the model is generally not the end of the project. Even if the purpose of the model is to increase knowledge of the data, the knowledge gained will need to be organized and presented in a way that is useful to the customer.
